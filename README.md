Welcome to the "Algorithm Implementation" repository, where you'll find robust implementations of various machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive ROC curve visualization. This collection includes the following algorithms:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
   -
   - Implementation of the KNN algorithm for regression tasks, visualization of the results.
   - Purpose: KNN is a versatile algorithm for classification and regression tasks, relying on proximity-based decision-making.

2. Linear Regression:
   -
   - A straightforward implementation of linear regression for predictive modeling.
   - Purpose: Linear regression is a fundamental technique for modeling relationships between variables in a dataset.

3. K-fold Cross-Validation algorithm:
   -
   - Implementation of K-fold Cross Validation from scratch without using any helping library.
   - Purpose: K-fold Cross-Validation is crucial for assessing model performance by partitioning the dataset into K subsets and iteratively training and testing.
  
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):
   -
   - Algorithmic implementation of LDA, a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and classification.
   - Purpose: LDA is employed for feature extraction and classification, particularly in scenarios with multiple classes.
